          <h5 class="center"> Our Story and Purpose</h5>
          <p class="light">Travel Map began in 2020 in Madanthyar as a student project. </p>
          <p>When you’re on your way to somewhere, the bus leaves the stop or moves towards its destination just a couple of minutes before you reach the stop. Hence, you will end up waiting for next bus. </p>
          <p>Luckily, the progress in technology has provided us with several genius ways to monitor the vehicles/buses. With TravelMap, you won’t miss your bus again. </p>
          <p>You can count on TravelMap to provide you with real-time data for the bus transport option in the selected area. We created TravelMap with the user’s perspective in mind. We keep it simple, so users of all categories can access it. You can search for bus options in an area and its timings. </p>
