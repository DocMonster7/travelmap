        <p>Welcome to TravelMap. We are Shivani and Farzana, the friend’s founders of TravelMap. WE believe in travel with no regrets. Our goal is to help you on your journey. </p>
        <center>Our Story: </center>
        <p>TravelMap began in 2020 in Mangaluru as a student project. </p>
        <p>When you’re on your way to somewhere, the bus leaves the stop or moves towards its destination just a couple of minutes before you reach the stop. Hence, you will end up waiting for next bus. </p>
        <p>Luckily, the progress in technology has provided us with several genius ways to monitor the vehicles/buses. With TravelMap, you won’t miss your bus again. </p>
        <p>You can count on TravelMap to provide you with real-time data for the bus transport option in the selected area. We created TravelMap with the user’s perspective in mind. We keep it simple, so users of all categories can access it. You can search for bus options in an area and its timings. </p>
        <center>Our future goals: </center>
        <p>Our system is continuously under development and we are working round the clock to improve it. We try to build a user-friendly approach for travel. </p>
